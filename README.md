Hello! My name is Arafat Lugma, I am the National School of Physics and Maths 11 grade student. 
I am really passionate about Computer Science, Data Science and AI. This research project
was made by myself to increase the awareness of people about domestic violence over women in Kazakhstan
by collecting data through open sources from Internet.
